client->request->server(nodejs)

when server receives the request it stores the request in the event queue(fifo),
the request(syncronous(blocking) or asynchronous(non-blocking)) is then taken by eventloop,
eventloop then processes the request, if it is non-bolcking it sends the response to the client back,
if it is blocking operation it takes a thread from the threadpool for processing the request then returns to the client.
if no threads are available in threadpool the next incoming requests will have to wait for the threads.

by default the threads will be 4 and the max threads we can have will the the no.of cores the system have(depends on the system(cpus)).
